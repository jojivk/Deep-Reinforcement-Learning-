# 1. Deep-Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement learning is rooted in psychological and neurological perspective of animal behavior. In many cases the environment can be too complex that the number of states is not enumerable to a finite set. Animals and humans learn the complex environment around them through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems. DQN was one of the ground-breaking use of Deep neural networks in reinforcement learning to learn Atari games.
